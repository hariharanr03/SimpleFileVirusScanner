If you want to add a new virus scanner, you can simply implement the 
`net.ngotzmann.SimpleFileVirusScan.virusscanner.VirusScanner` interface.  
Your virus scanner bean must be spring managed!   
  
Set the `virusscanner.beanName=yourVirusScannerBeanName` application property to your beanName.  
To test if your virus scanner work, maybe adjust and execute the 
`net.ngotzmann.SimpleFileVirusScan.virusscanner.FileServiceIntegrationTest` class.
